# Student Management System (Version 3)

## Live Demo

Try the application here: [Student Management System](https://student-management-8nnhhly4g-minh-toans-projects.vercel.app/)

## Introduction

This project is an enhanced version of the Student Management System, designed to manage student information efficiently with advanced features and stricter data validation. Building on Version 2, Version 3 introduces unique student IDs, configurable email domains, phone number formatting, controlled status changes, time-based deletion restrictions, and export capabilities for student status certificates. All data continues to be stored in the browser's local storage, with added unit tests and code coverage for improved reliability.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Add new student records with detailed information

- **Search Students**: Search for students by name, department, and other criteria
- **Filter Students**: Filter students by gender, department, course, program, and status
  ![Search Students Interface](./screenshots/search-student.jpg)
- **Import/Export Data**: Import and export student data in CSV and JSON formats

  ![Export JSON](./screenshots/export-json.jpg)
- **Category Management**: Manage categories such as departments, programs, and statuses

- **Logging**: Log all actions for auditing and troubleshooting
  ![Logging](./screenshots/log-manager.jpg)
- **Unique Student ID (MSSV)**: Ensure student IDs are unique when adding or updating records
- **Configurable Email Domains**: Restrict email addresses to specific domains (e.g., @student.university.edu.vn)
- **Valid Phone Number Formatting**: Enforce country-specific phone number formats (e.g., +84 or 0[3|5|7|8|9]xxxxxxxx for Vietnam)
- **Controlled Student Status Changes**: Allow status changes only according to predefined rules (e.g., "Studying" → "On Leave", "Graduated", or "Suspended", but not "Graduated" back to "Studying")
  ![Validation](./screenshots/validation-data.jpg)
- **Time-Based Deletion**: Allow deletion of student records only within a configurable time frame (e.g., 30 minutes) after creation
  ![Limit-Time](./screenshots/delete-time-limit.jpg)
- **Toggle Validation Rules**: Enable or disable validation rules dynamically by config file
- **University Branding**: Display the university logo or name on all screens
  ![Display Logo](./screenshots/display-logo.jpg)
- **Category Deletion with Constraints**: Allow deletion of departments, statuses, or programs only if no student data is associated
  ![Delete Constraint](./screenshots/delete-constraint.jpg)
- **Export Student Status Certificates**: Generate student status certificates in two formats (HTML, MD)
  ![Export HTML Certificates](./screenshots/html-format.jpg)
  ![Export Markdown Certificates](./screenshots/md-format.jpg)
- **Unit Tests and Code Coverage**: Implement unit tests and measure code coverage for key modules (logManager.js, studentManager.js)

## Installation

### Method 1: Using Git and Node.js

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JonasAugust12/student-management
   cd student-management
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Live Server (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g live-server
   ```
